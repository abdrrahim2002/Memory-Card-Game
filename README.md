## Why I Created This Game
I created this game as a mini-project to practice my skills in web development, particularly working with JavaScript for game logic and CSS for design and responsiveness. It also gave me a chance to experiment with adding sound effects for an interactive touch. Building this game was a fun way to reinforce my understanding of web technologies.

## Features
- **Random Card Placement:** Cards are shuffled randomly each time the game starts.
- **Sound Effects:** Different sounds play for matching pairs, missing pairs, and when the game is completed.
- **Live Preview:** You can run this game in a live server directly through VS Code.

## How to Play
- Click on two cards to flip them.
- If the cards match, they stay flipped.
- If they don’t match, they will flip back after a short delay.
- Continue flipping cards until all pairs are matched.
- Enjoy the sound effects for different actions like misses, matches, and completing the game.
